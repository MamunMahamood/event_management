# Event Management

**Project Creator:** Golam Mahamood Mamun

## Project Description:

Event Management is the Web Application using raw PHP. Also using HTML, CSS, JS. In this app We can manage Event like create, update, delete, show and along with Event Publish or UnPublish that only Admin can do. All published Event will be shown to Guest User. Guest User can see the published Event and also see Detailed Event Page. Also Integrated Map Location Street api using `https://www.openstreetmap.org/`. My intenstion to integrate Google Map api, But I can use that api because of Billing issue of google service. Also add search and filtering fetures.

## Project Role:
In this Project we defined two users, One is Guest and Other is Admin.

`Guests` don't have to Register or Login. They just can visit the Index and Event detailed page.

`Admins` have to Register and Login, and then they can create, edit, delete and publish or unpublish the Event.
